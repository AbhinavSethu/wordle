# Wordle Game in Python (Jupyter Notebook)

## 📌 Overview
This is a Python-based Wordle game implemented in a Jupyter Notebook. It replicates the popular word-guessing game where players attempt to guess a secret five-letter word within six attempts. After each guess, feedback is provided to indicate correct letters in the correct position (🟩), correct letters in the wrong position (🟨), or incorrect letters (⬜).

## ✨ Features
- Interactive command-line gameplay.
- Colored output for clear feedback.
- Word validation against a predefined list.
- Runs in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

## 🛠️ Installation & Requirements
To run this game, you need:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries (install with `pip` if necessary):
  ```sh
  pip install notebook
  ```

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open Jupyter Notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Load the `wordle.ipynb` file.
3. Run the notebook cells sequentially.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.

## 🎮 How to Play
1. Enter a five-letter word as your guess.
2. Receive feedback:
   - 🟩 (Green): Letter is in the correct position.
